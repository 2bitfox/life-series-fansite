                        third life was a short minecraft series based on the concept of every player starting with 3 lives. any time they die, they lose a life, and hitting zero means they're 
                        done with the series. <span style='color: #4bd506'>Green</span> and <span style='color: #f0c412'>Yellow</span> lives play the game like normal, and 
                        <span style='color: #e60707'>Red</span> lives are supposed to try and kill other players.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        the members of third life were Grian, Scar, Bdubs, Bigb, Impulse, Martyn, Ren, Tango, Etho, Scott, Joel, Skizz, Cleo, and Jimmy. they are listed here in the order they died, starting
                        with who died last and ending with the first out of the series. funnily enough, in all three 'life series so far, Jimmy was the first one to lose all of his lives. 
                        (although, in last life, he lost the fewest lives total - he only had two lives and never gained any from another player)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        third life is succeeded by <b>last life</b>, <b>double life</b>, and a <s>currently unnammed series that is theorized to be released in March of 2023</s> 
                        this fourth series, called <b>limited life</b> has been released as of 3/3/2023! each version has a different gimmick.

                    </p>
                    <h4>last life</h4>

                    <p>last life's gimmick was that each player got a randomized number of lives at the start, anywhere from two to seven, and could trade lives with 
                    each other. this game <i>also</i> introduced the <b>bogeyman</b>, who would be randomly chosen from all <i>non-red</i> players, and would have to kill another player b the end of the
                    session else they'd drop directly to their final life, regardless of their current life count.</p>

                    <p>the members of last life were Scott, Ren, Martyn, Pearl, Joel, Etho, Grian, Cleo, Scar, Bigb, Tango, Bdubs, Lizzie, Impulse, Skizz, Mumbo, and Jimmy.</p>

                    <h4>double life</h4>
                    <p>
                        double life went back to the three lives of third life, <i>however</i>, each player had their life count bound to a soulmate, where they shared health and lives. the 
                        shared healthbar meant that any damage taken by one would also affect the other, and anything that killed one would kill the other. they also did not know who their 
                        soulmate was at the start - they had to find them in the first session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        the double life duos were:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Pearl â™¡ Scott</li>
                            <li>Martyn â™¡ Cleo</li>
                            <li>Bdubs â™¡ Impulse</li>
                            <li>Joel â™¡ Etho</li>
                            <li>Grian â™¡ Scar</li>
                            <li>Bigb â™¡ Ren</li>
                            <li>Jimmy â™¡ Tango</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>limited life</h4>
                    <p>the gimmick of limited life is that lives are time - each player starts with 24 hours, and dying takes one hour from that time. 24-16 hours is a <span style='color: #4bd506'>Green</span> life, 16-8 hours 
                    is a <span style='color: #f0c412'>Yellow</span> life, and 8-0 hours is a <span style='color: #e60707'>Red</span> life. this series also brings back the bogeyman mechanic! 
                    someone who kills when becoming the bogeyman gains an hour back, and the person they killed 
                    looses two hours, and when the bogeyman <i>fails</i> to make a kill, they drop down an entire color.</p>

                    <p>green lives cannot kill other players (unles they're chosen as the bogeyman), yellow lives can kill green lives, and red lives can kill anyone. the incentive
                    to kill someone is that killing another player adds 30 minutes to your timer.</p>
